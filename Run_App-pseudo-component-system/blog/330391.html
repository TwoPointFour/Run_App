            <div class="col-8">Many people who run in the morning are making a mistake. Many runners believe that running at night is bad. This has been confirmed by research that shows most exercisers do better exercising in the morning and not evening.

            <div class="col-8">Is it bad to change the time I exercise? And does it matter if I run or do other kinds of workouts? The best place to start is with the research. In a study, researchers found that morning exercisers reported doing a better job staying on their exercise program than those who exercised in the evening.

In my digging through research on running and habit forming I kept seeing this one little note that people who run at night do a better job staying on their exercise program than those who exercise in the evening - even though the total amount of hours spent exercising was the same. The goal then becomes to find a way to get your run in and have the self discipline to do it at an inconvenient time.

            <div class="col-8">Have you ever thought about what was happening at the gym when the sun went down?... I mean besides all of the dorky people like me. After seeing a couple of studies on running during the day and night versus during the day and night it got me thinking.
