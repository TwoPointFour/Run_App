            <div class="col-8">“Where do I even begin,” I asked myself. Though the running basics are straightforward, The running “basics” were enough to fuel me for a good 4-5 weeks. Now it was time for a new challenge; to go from a basic runner to an intermediate one…

            <div class="col-8">Some weeks ago I had run a half marathon in 1 hour and 34 mins, while most of my friends were running ~50km/week. At that time, I told myself I got enough “basic” training and it was time to start my “intermediate” training.

            <div class="col-8">At that time, I told myself I got enough “basic” training and it was time to start my “intermediate” training. The progress I started making changed the way I approached running for the rest of my high school career. Although there were many other periods where I would go through a period of stagnation, each time that happened, there were some specific things that could be attributed to it. And when I discovered certain things that helped me break out of these periods – my mindset and approach to running would change again for the better.

            <div class="col-8">Let me start off by saying that I didn't know how to train for running in high school. I started out my freshman and sophomore years with very little knowledge of what it took to be good at something like track or cross country. By the time I had gained any real level of success at the varsity level, I noticed something: most people who do have passion for running only ever compete on a high-school level. From this realization, I've learned that if you want to succeed beyond high school, then there are some important factors you should be aware of upon entering your first training regimen.

By the time I had gained any real level of success at the varsity level, my coaches started to stress about repetition we could have been doing that would have made me faster.

            <div class="col-8">I shook at the thought of a college coach ever looking at my running times. The abstract concept of “repetition” didn't matter to me. Even if it would have led to future success, I was more concerned with enjoying life the way I wanted to rather than worrying about doing things the “right way”. Ultimately, I made a lot of mistakes in my approach to running college cross country and track. To this day it bugs me that a simple lack of repetition almost prevented me from becoming a faster runner and getting recruited by a Division I school.

            <div class="col-8">I started running track when I was a freshman in high school in order to get better at basketball. I played guard and forward, and struggled to run faster than 5:00/mile. My conditioning certainly needed improvement before I could reach my potential on the court. The coach saw a lot of potential in me as a runner, and convinced me to remain focused on improving my running speed and endurance. He told me that I needed to put my focus into getting stronger and faster to win championships. He preached about putting in the time and how repetition is the only way to get faster. His voice was reassuring but I didn't believe him…

            <div class="col-8">In middle school, I played basketball for my high school's club team. I was so nervous at tryouts I couldn't sleep the night before. After some drills, we did a few sprints and timed runs. Even though I could shoot baskets very well, I struggled to run faster than 5:00/mile. My conditioning certainly needed improvement before I could reach my potential on the court.

In 2010, I won three of the four world marathons I entered while achieving a personal best of 2 hours and 13 minutes — almost two minutes faster than in any other marathon to date. In 2011, I won a fourth marathon. It took 14 years of training and racing to reach that point – 14 years that were full of ups and downs, progress and setbacks, joys and frustrations. At first it was hard for me to believe that something so difficult could have been achieved so easily. But after a few years the mystery started to fade and it became easier to spot the flaws in my running development. Although not all problems were solved, I knew what
