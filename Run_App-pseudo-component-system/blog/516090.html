Even if you're having a great run, the timer will eventually lure you into listening to music or watching TV. These distractions soon become all-consuming, and you no longer have a valuable workout. Here are some tips to help you run effectively on the treadmill and improve your overall endurance.

            <div class="col-8">While watching TV or listening to music on your mp3 player, it is very easy to lose track of time and still not get a quality workout. It's essential to work out with a timer in order to obtain the benefits you want. The workout is easy, whether you have just a few minutes a day, or plan on doing more. With the notion that you don't have much time for exercises, it's best not to do strenuous workouts such as running up and down flights of stairs, jogging or going at top speed on a treadmill. On days when we have more time for exercising, we can move into the next level that will improve our endurance and strengthen muscles.

            <div class="col-8">Over the years I have discovered that trying to workout by time and not intervals is almost impossible. Many people don't know this, but you get the most out of your workout if you are working on a timer and also working it in intervals. This means that you give your body rest and work for a desired amount of time. This strategy can save time in order for you to achieve the results you are looking for.

Mush longer workouts aren't as good for burning fat or even just building bone density or muscle mass. You will need to work out at least three times per week and need to push yourself no less than 60 minutes for each workout. Working from home isn't what it used to be, so the amount of

            <div class="col-8">The key to building lean muscle is to work out at a desired intensity for a limited time. You can do this by running in intervals or giving your body rest in between for about three minutes.

            <div class="col-8">In running, interval training is used to raise your running speed while also giving you rest to achieve this speed. This could be done by doing longer intervals between walking and moderate paced running as well. You choose what interval of walking and running you wish to do in order to help increase your endurance and improve your overall health over time. One example is by alternating between two minutes of a fast pace with about three minutes of walking in between.

The end result is that despite their best efforts, they never improve beyond a 5-K. And they never make the leap into the marathon distance because it's just too hard for them to run up hills.
