I also managed to run a sub 24 minute 10k for the first time only this year! That success was down to a mixture of training effectively, listening to my body throughout the training, and putting in what you might call 'sweat equity'. The start was definitely the hardest part but now I can hardly wait for my next event.

            <div class="col-8">Several years ago, my buddy, Adriaan Potgieter mentioned to me that he is running his first marathon. I was impressed and thought how crazy and stupid that he will be to run 42km. I never questioned him or told him that it is impossible. Years later, we were training for all kinds of races such as 10ks and half marathons and he started to beat me in all those races. That was when I thought that maybe he wasn't so far away from accomplishing a full marathon. And one day, the eureka moment came, when I told him (almost begging), that he should try ultra-marathon because this guy can run forever. He thought about it for a while but

The most important thing is to get into the habit of exercising because once you do it is not hard to continue doing it.
