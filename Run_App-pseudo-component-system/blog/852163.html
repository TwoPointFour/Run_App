            <div class="col-8">Running is a great activity for most of us. You don't need anything to start running and the benefits are amazing. But it still remains a lonely experience sometimes as you can't share it with your friends or family. You can, however, create an immersive experience by utilizing digital tools designed for runners.

            <div class="col-8">Are you getting lonely when you go out for a run? If you're like me, you tend to enjoy your workout more when you're with other people. It can be as simple as running with family or friends (� my guilty pleasure is to use the Nike + Running app). Sometimes I play along and compete with my virtual buddy, who happens to be an avatar of Ryan Gosling (I find this makes speedier progress than attempting to outrun the herd of elephants behind me.) While there are times when that kind of company isn't feasible, there are still ways to make your jog social: by using a companion app.

            <div class="col-8">When I'm running alone, I usually at least carry my phone so that I can listen to music or podcasts. But I've noticed that when I'm with other people�my family, that is�I tend to run more than when I'm alone. The same goes for a lot of runners who have more friends on social media than in real life. Studies show that most social networkers don't have these kinds of in-person interactions. If you have few friends around you, maybe it would be better to invite more people to come join you in your fitness activities.

            <div class="col-8">I'm not a fan of social media, to be honest. I don't like using it and I don't see much value in it. That's why running usually offers me a way out of my own head and ruins the feeling of always being connected by social media. A few weeks ago, I started pondering how social media could change my relationship with running.

            <div class="col-8">Running. It's a great way to clear your head. A form of meditation, and a great way to stay in shape on top of that. And I've recently found myself wondering how social media could integrate itself into running. That's what brought me to thinking about my Apple Watch. It is an amazing device for tracking my runs and displaying useful information, especially when I run with GPS enabled. But I find it almost impossible to get the most out of the Apple Watch while I'm running or even walking outdoors, since the screen is so tiny that you can't read anything more than a few words at a time. But then there's this brand new device that has definitely caught my attention: The Apple AirPods .

And I've recently found myself wondering how social media could integrate itself into running. That's what brought me to thinking about my Apple Watch. It is an amazing device for tracking distance, pace, calories burned, etc. and you can use your iPhone or iPad as a remote control, right?

And I've recently found myself wondering how social media could integrate itself into running. That's what brought me to thinking about my Apple Watch. It is a little computer watch , right? So why not connect to your Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and Snapchat accounts so you never have to stop running or be bored with running? You can get notifications instantly and without even taking out your phone.

My phone is so powerful that it can replace my microphone. My phone is so powerful that it can replace my flashlight. I'm not saying in this article that those things are wrong or you shouldn't do it - you totally should. That's why your cell phone is one of the most useful items on your person now days. But, we have yet to really integrate itself into running. That's what brought me to thinking about my Apple Watch. It is a little device that isn't all that different than my phone, yet different because it's strapped to my wrist and has the potential to be a great tool for training

            <div class="col-8">Let's talk about the power of your phone. It is so powerful, that with just a single app (and the right permission), it can replace 'dumb' devices that we've traditionally used. Camera: check, you have a ton of them with your phones! Microphone: check, also more than enough on your phone! Flashlight: check, same thing. You shouldn't be saying that you need those extra 'dumb' devices. We're going to discuss 3 of my favorite apps that allow you to do these things with your phone and how they are powerful for entrepreneurs.

They're working on a new Android app called TwoPointFour. The idea behind the app is to allow you to use smartphones as replacements for existing 'dumb' devices like flashlights and fans , due to their always-on camera, microphone, and built-in accelerometer.

A possible solution to this issue could be if we integrated the functionality of a cell phone into every smartphone case and device which can help you out in times of need. That is what TwoPointFour has created, which is a running app that can replace existing dumb devices like flashlights, lanterns and radios.

Although modern technology has enabled us to integrate cell phone(s) with a more durable electronic device, such as a smartwatch or other fitness tracker, many people still like the sleek and minimal design of their smartphones. This means they prefer to hide away their phones in their pockets or purses, then take them out once they reach their destination and want to make any calls or answer any messages.
