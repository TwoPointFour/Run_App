            <div class="col-8">My name is Dan and I am a software engineer at TwoPointFour. Prior to joining the world of software development I was a professional runner and had achieved a lot in my running career. Completing the London marathon with just 12 months training under my belt, taking 23 minutes off the previous record for the 127 mile run from Brighton to Cardiff. I achieved this using a personal digital running tool called TwoPointFour which can help you improve your running through 3D audio technology.

            <div class="col-8">As an advocate for health and fitness, I am actively aware of ways I can keep up with healthier habits and stay active. When I discovered TwoPointFour on BeTheRunner's website, I was intrigued by its design and concept. It is essentially a digital running tool that uses advanced algorithms to help you reach your fitness goals.

            <div class="col-8">When it comes to running training, one size does not fit all. Typically, people are given the same training programmes created for those at the top of the sport even though they may have totally different fitness levels. Not all training programmes are created equal and some can actually be counter-productive because they fail to take into account the runner's unique abilities. For example, a beginner runner with an injury may need to focus on building up strength and flexibility before hitting the pavement. This type of training can be carried out using digital running tools such as TwoPointFour which provides runners with individualised running programmes based on their personal fitness level."
