As a matter of fact, if you go out and purchase some running shoes, lace them up and head out to run as fast and far as you can, I can almost guarantee that you will get injured. Unfortunately, many people don't know that there are a lot of things you must do before you even start training.

        <div class="col-8">Before I get into what steps you need to take to run well, let's talk about you and why it is so important that you start running. You probably want to begin running because you have heard of all the great health benefits it has to offer. However, its health benefits are not the only reason why people should start running early in their lives.

        <div class="col-8">There has been a lot of growth in the number of individuals that have started training for races. It's no big surprise that those that decide to start running do so with the intent to achieve a race time goal. Once they learn how to run, these individuals start training for their goal race. But as you can see above, just starting to train doesn't equal improved performance. There is work involved and factor that determine if you will be successful in improving your running ability.

        <div class="col-8">January 1st is quickly approaching. We've had a nice break from running since the end of November, but now it's time to get back into the swing of things. The best way to begin your New Year is with a good training plan. The chart above shows how easy a proper training plan can bring about great results in your running. It can also alter the course of your future marathons or races, help bring you closer to qualifying for Boston, or just provide you with some peaceful moments of grace on the roads.

        <div class="col-8">According to the chart, if you're one of those people who run irregularly or run for less than an hour a week, you're only getting 60% of the value that you can get out of running. In order to be able to get the full benefits and value from running, there are things that need to be taken care of before hand. You have to pick a running schedule and stick with it in order to ensure that you get down those repetitions without missing out on any.

        <div class="col-8">Before you start running, there is one thing I would like to point out: You should already be in shape. You can't expect to start running one day and do well at your first, second or t hird races. It simply doesn't work that way. And when you're training for a race, it's important to know the proper way of doing things so you can run as quickly as possible.
