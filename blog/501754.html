It is just what it sounds like: a sharper, crisper, and brighter display on your new iPad. Even though the pixels are smaller, you can still see more on the screen at one time. This means that you get more code in your editor and more images on your artboard.

            <div class="col-8">There are two ways to make your GitHub wiki page easier to view and read. The first is to shrink the page down. By default, your page will be full width, which means that everything has little room to breathe and you can't see as much code at once on the screen.

            <div class="col-8">You may have already had this experience: You're building a page with CSS, and it's gone great. You've put in styles for margin, padding, positioning, and everything else that you need. Then you get to that last detail � say a nice border under the navigation � and you realize your page won't fit. The reason is because your screen is full width and you can't see as much code at once on the screen.

            <div class="col-8">So you turn to hacks like using <p> tags to add padding, or adding display:inline-block; to change your nav. But these are hacks. They don't really belong in the markup, and they eventually cause more problems than they solve.

            <div class="col-8">In the last few months, I've watched two projects use CSS/HTML to fix broken navigation requirements. These navigation solutions were a bit different from the norm. Rather than creating an unordered list using the nav element, they made clever use of the :target CSS pseudo-class. This isn't an uncommon approach for dealing with responsive navigation since it's basically "the only way" to make anchors work across devices. But these are hacks. They don't really belong in the markup, and they eventually cause more problems than they solve.

One of my absolute favorites from 2010 was the now-defunct RapidPlay running app. These navigation solutions were a bit different from the norm.

            <div class="col-8">RapidPlay was a new type of running app combining the ability to find new music based on your tempo and listen while you went on your run, all tied into a social experience. These navigation solutions were a bit different from what the market had seen, (like Nike + iPod, Garmin Forerunner, and Map My Run), which meant RapidPlay was able to separate itself as a category leader.

            <div class="col-8">RapidPlay was an app I co-developed with a team of other students for the Duke Center for Innovation and Entrepreneurship called Dare to Create. The app was a music player designed to be used with headphones as you went on your run, plus it included turn by turn directions. The music was stored in the cloud and could be accessed by users from anywhere. It provided minimal distraction from your running experience while enabling you to listen while you ran. This enabled the user to both listen to their favorite playlist as well as allowing them to remain aware of where they were going during their run. RapidPlay provided a new and unique experience for music listening that allowed the user to concentrate on their own running experience.

            <div class="col-8">I used to attend many PodCamp conferences and run the first online storytelling running app: 2 Point 4 Hours. I tried to get my friends to listen to my story no matter where I met them or how long I had known them. After a while, people started listening because they wanted good stories of their own. If you work on becoming a better storyteller, your friends will listen more.

            <div class="col-8">Four hours is how long it took me to create a running app. I could have spent more time on it but I was happy with the outcome. When I released my app, I couldn't think of anyone who wouldn't want one. A lot of friends said that they could use one like mine so before the app was taken down, I made sure that they got an email with the link.

            <div class="col-8">When I decided to start RapidPlay running app, a few years ago, I had my sights set on getting one million downloads. When I started this app, it was a huge success as people started downloading and using it. My goal was to build an app that would help people track their running workouts and become more informed about their progress. After a few months of releasing the app, I ran into some issues and had to take it down for a couple of days. Although many people were unhappy with the disruptions, all in all, I ended up being happy with the outcome.

As I have shed the pounds in a period where I have developed my first iOS app, RapidPlay running app, I have benefited tremendously from tracking my training sessions. Tracking my runs has been an eye opener because it helps me understand better how I work out while also helping me identify weaknesses in my running route which ultimately helps me improve myself every time.
