Running helps to improve your cardiovascular system, so that you are able to run longer and faster. It's also great for toning up your body--runner's are known as some of the fittest people around.

What's worse is that I know I'm going to run no matter how much I complain about it or how badly it hurts me. Please help me." - Plenty of people have thought that about running, even during their first run of the day, and they are not necessarily masochists or gluttons for punishment.(

On one hand, it seems silly to run three miles every day just to eat more. On the other hand, it makes no sense to run farther and farther just to get back home. There are endless marathons you could join where you run for 37 hours straight just to finish the race. Honestly, I don't know anyone who has had the patience and determination to finish such a marathon. What I found, after a few weeks with my 3-mile routine, is that my appetite was under control and I felt better about myself

On the other hand, it makes no sense to run farther and farther just so you can eat. The truth is, you don't need huge amounts of exercise for weight loss. You do need patience, consistency and a strategy that works for you. If you're committed to following my advice, then in six weeks or less, you'll be running anywhere from two to four miles per day (depending on your starting point) while continuing the weight loss you desire.

I should have eaten a good breakfast and then added in 200-300 calories for lunch, but I did not do that. I woke up at 6:00am to run before work just so I could eat through the rest of my day.
