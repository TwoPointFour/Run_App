It's normal to have cravings for and to be tempted by foods that aren't good for your training. Especially around the holidays, there are tons of temptations and lots of people giving you food. Here are some tips from me and my fellow athletes on how to make healthy choices this time of year.

Admittedly, I used to belong to the latter camp, but all of those resolutions wilted like lettuce in a hot climate thanks to summer. Is that because it's too hot to run, play tennis, play football? No. They had other priorities. Many people probably would

Admittedly, I used to belong to the latter camp, but all of those resolutions wilted like lettuce in a hot climate thanks to summer's scorching heat. My current regimen is simple and effective: run every day for 30 minutes while listening to books on tape. In the beginning, I was a little intimated by running but once I got out there it was never so easy. Losing weight isn't always about dieting; you

Running really can do just that. Some runners are responding to my plea for advice by sharing stories  of how they lost weight for themselves and their partners, or be more productive at work.

But after competing in the Women's Half Marathon in DC this past weekend, it felt like the right time to tell the world. Not everyone will agree with running or understand what true motivation is for running. And that's okay. It took me years to get to this spot of mentally feeling like I can tell anyone about running and diet . The hardest thing is taking that first step into trying something new, something that seems uncomfortable. It's just sitting yourself down and strapping some shoes to your feet.
