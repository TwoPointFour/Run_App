            <div class="col-8">The marathon is the most famous road race in the world. Because of that, many people want to run this distance and are unsure of where to start. Before you begin training for a marathon, you must first decide if you can actually complete one. Do not be surprised if your friends, co-workers or family members question your decision. They will tell you that it is too far to run and that you won't be able to finish one. They may even tell you that running 26 miles is impossible. I know this because when I told my friends I was going to run a marathon, many of them questioned me or told me that it is impossible. Years later, we were training for all kinds of races such as 10K,

Before you begin training for a marathon, you must first decide if you can actually complete one. Do not be surprised if your friends, co-workers or family members try and discourage you once they find out your plans. Even those who are not die-hard runners may think that you can't accomplish your goal. Everyone involved in your life might tell you these excuses: "I'm too old", "I have two bad knees", "It's too boring," and my personal favorite, �I'm not built for it." They're wrong; anyone can train for and complete a marathon if they follow these simple steps.

Do not be surprised if your friends, co-workers or family members try and discourage you once they find out your plans. Marathon running has earned a reputation as a somewhat masochistic sport due to the common practice of �hitting the wall� (commonly referred to by runners as bonking). Most non-runners have never experienced true exhaustion like the kind experienced when you back-to-back 10-mile runs, which is the equivalent of what some marathons require of their finishers.

As of this article's release, there are only a mere 134 days until the 2018 TCS New York City Marathon , which will be run on November 4th (as per its official website ). In the lead-up to the race, I see many aspiring runners asking all sorts of questions about training programs � whether they should follow one or �just wing it� when they get there (always a bad idea). Having run marathons in both New York and Chicago , I feel like I can give reasonably well-informed answers to these questions from my own experiences as a runner. That being said, you may
