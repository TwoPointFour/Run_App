You want to have a proper warm up and cool down before and after each workout. This allows for your muscles to be warmed up and properly stretched. A proper running program is important to ensure that you are exercising the right muscles at the right time so that you can avoid injury.

This got me started, and now I am writing this post because running has become an important part of my life, part of my diet, and part of my training.

How many times have I heard someone say that they want to run but they can't because they have too many errands? Errands are for screwing around! Screw errands — get out for a run! You've got gear, right? A good pair of running shoes and a smaller backpack (backpack) just for your phone and essentials is good enough. It's time to stop talking and get out there.
