      <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
      <p>
        All changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they are posted on this page. When we
        change the policy in a material manner, we will let you know via email and/or a prominent
        notice on our web site prior to the change becoming effective and update the ‘effective
        date’ at the top of this page. This document sets forth our Privacy Policy and advises you
        about the information we collect, how we collect it, how we secure and protect it, and what
        choices you have about how that information is used.
      </p>
      <p>
        In summary, the personal fitness/health related information we collect helps us to provide
        the best possible workout suggestions for the individual user on our site. Given the nature
        of the personal data we work with, we pledge to protect your privacy and keep your personal
        information secure and confidential. The personal information you share with TwoPointFour is
        kept strictly confidential and fully secure unless you, the user, specifically request
        otherwise.
      </p>
      <h2>1. Privacy Officer</h2>
      <p>
        In summary, the personal fitness/health related information we collect helps us to provide
        the best possible workout suggestions for the individual user on our site. Given the nature
        of the personal data we work with, we pledge to protect your privacy and keep your personal
        information secure and confidential. The personal information you share with TwoPointFour is
        kept strictly confidential and fully secure unless you, the user, specifically request
        otherwise.
      </p>
      <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
      <p>
        We collect information from you in the following manner: A. Non-Personally Identifying
        Information about visitors to our Sites and Applications B. Personally Identifying
        Information C. Information you supply when you create an account with user name and password
        D. Responses to questions you answer in the App
      </p>
      <h2>3. How We Protect Your Information</h2>
      <p>
        TwoPointFour keeps all your personal information confidential in our secure system. No other
        user can view or change your information without your Username and Password. TwoPointFour
        puts you, the user, in control of your personal information. You can edit, update or delete
        information that you have provided by sending an email to twopointfourapp@gmail.com.
        TwoPointFour controls all personal data gathered via our Sites. All data is secured in a
        top-tier secure hosting facility.
      </p>
      <p>
        Only authorized TwoPointFour employees (with special system access controls and passwords)
        are permitted or able to access your personal information. All TwoPointFour employees must
        abide by our code of conduct, security and privacy policies and those who violate this
        policy are subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination.
      </p>
      <p>
        No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100%
        secure. Therefore, we cannot guarantee the absolute security of your information. If a
        breach of your personal information occurs, we will provide notifications as per regulatory
        requirements. In that event, TwoPointFour would no longer have the ability to protect your
        information. By using our Site and Applications you acknowledge that there is risk that the
        information you share with us may be compromised, despite our efforts to protect it.
      </p>

        to the information in their user account (including updating email address and changing
        password). If you are unsure of how to update any of your previously provided information,

        acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, you will be notified via email
